  <h1>NORTH EAST INDIA</h1>
        <p>
       The region is covered by the mighty Brahmaputra-Barak river systems and their tributaries. <br>
       Geographically, apart from the Brahmaputra, Barak and Imphal valleys and some flatlands in between <br>
       the hills of Meghalaya and Tripura, the remaining two-thirds of the area is hilly terrain interspersed <br>
       with valleys and plains; the altitude varies from almost sea-level to over 7,000 metres (23,000 ft) above MSL. <br>
       The region's high rainfall, averaging around 10,000 millimetres (390 in) and above creates problems of the ecosystem, <br>
       high seismic activity, and floods. The states of Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim have a montane climate with cold, <br>
       snowy winters and mild summers.
